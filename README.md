# Loan-Eligibility-Analysis
## Project Background
The financial services industry, particularly the insurance and banking domains, heavily relies on analytics and data science to improve decision-making and risk assessment. One of the key challenges faced by lending institutions is determining the eligibility of applicants for loans in a fair, efficient, and scalable manner. Traditionally, loan approval has involved manual checks on applicantsâ€™ demographic information, income levels, loan amount requested, and credit history. However, with the rise of digital platforms and the need for real-time decisions, manual processes are no longer sufficient.

To address this challenge, the company aims to automate the loan eligibility process by leveraging data analytics. The dataset used for this project contains 615 records and 13 attributes covering applicant details such as gender, marital status, education, number of dependents, income, loan amount, loan term, property area, and credit history. By applying classification techniques, this project seeks to identify key factors influencing loan approval and to build a reliable model that predicts whether an applicant is eligible for a loan.
